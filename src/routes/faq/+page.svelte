    <h4>What is pitcher?</h4>
    <p>
        Pitcher is a web-based theoretical perfect pitch training system that uses color association to help listeners determine the note they are hearing. It is designed to help musicians and music producers improve their pitch accuracy and overall musical ability.

    <h4>How does it work?</h4>
    <p>
        Pitcher plays a musical note and after a short delay (which varies based on difficulty level) reveals both the note that was played and its associated color. This simple system helps train your ear to recognize pitch through consistent color associations.
